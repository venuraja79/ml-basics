## Machine learning material for absolute beginners.
This course is designed for absolute beginners in Machine Learning with no previous knowledge
in ML techniques. 

**Lecture 1. Machine Learning Intuition**

The intention here is to provide a basic intuition of **Machine Learning** (ML) that is applicable to many problems. This notebook is fully written in basic python, no higher level packages have been used.

**Lecture 2. Linear Regression with numpy**

In this lecture, we introduce the importance of vectorization and provide the vectorized implementation
for the Linear model. Also, provide an overview of broadcasting.

**Lecture 3. Classification - Logistic Regression**

Classification is a bread and butter task in Machine Learning. Given a few categories, we train a model 
using a dataset, that predicts the category/class of the new data point. 

As usual, we will define a toy dataset and build out the complete logistic classification model from scratch
in python. We will leverage cross entropy loss function to train the model.
